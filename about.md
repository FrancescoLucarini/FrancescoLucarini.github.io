## >whoami

I study Computer Engineering at Sapienza Università di Roma (Italy), I really enjoy everything that involves out-of-box thinking.
My dream job would be Vulnerability Researcher, searching for bugs is so cool especially if they spawn a root shell or escape browsers or vitual machines... (but for now I am stil learning!)

**What are my current abilities?**

I can work in C and Python, but I can read asm. Most of the time you will see me debugging stuff or exploiting or maybe both especially on gdb (pwndbg actually!), but I am also learning how to debug windbg. 
I am learning how to write fuzzers with libfuzzer actually, and after I finally learned rust I will learn also LibAfl.

In a hacking and CTF context I feel more comfortable with Binary Exploitation (cuz spawning a shell is kinda cool :) !): but I never lose the opportunity to learn something concerning the other categories like Sandbox Escape, Crypto and Reverse Engineering. 
In my free time I enjoy learning on sites like pwn.college, ret2 wargame or play some challenges of old ctf.
Also every weekend I try to play CTFs with my Academic Team [Hackappatoi](https://hackappatoi.github.io/).

I’m really available to collaborate and work with someone! Every experience is precious! So if you want to ask me anything or to propose any project just [contact me](contact.md).
